Submission (made to Moodle):

*Mid-term report (due on 11/14/2023). The mid-term report should include a description of how the program is (or will be) designed, including the design of the classes and their inheritance relation. Please describe the process of critical functionality (in the form of pseudo-code or step-by-step instructions). Please also provide the use cases of your program. You can refer to zyBooks 11.8 to learn how to use UML to describe your OOP design.*


*Two-page (or more if necessary) final report explaining how the program was designed (can be different from the mid-term report), what classes were used and implemented, and the instructions to operate the program (some use cases)
*

A link to a video clip (must be no longer than 10 minutes) showing the class design and implementation (by showing source code), and demonstrating all the required functionality listed above.


Source code (including .h,.cpp and other necessary project files only) as a single .zip file. DO NOT include “Debug” or “Release” folders under your project.
